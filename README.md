# Portfolio-Website
Personal portfolio website is a web development project that I have created to showcase some of my skills, projects, and accomplishments.  
To get a better understanding of the project, you can open the file using a web browser or a text editor that supports HTML files. By doing so, you'll be able to see the website's structure, design, and any associated code, such as HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, that have been used to create the website.
